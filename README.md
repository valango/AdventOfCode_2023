# Advent Of Code '2023

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.<br />Estonian private leaderboard (by petskratt) code
is `652748`.

## Diary

* `Day 01` **Trebuchet?!**: The part #2 had quite a clever trap in it, making initial _"common sense"_ 😁 left-to-right
  approach fail.
* `Day 02` **Cube Conundrum**: Very simple once you understand the task. I am a slow reader, though.
* `Day 03` **Gear ratios**: I absolutely HATE _any tasks_ that involve keeping track of _**position indices**_! 🤮
  The parts adjacency checking is too complex, because I expected the parts can be of any length - this did not happen.
* `Day 04` **Scratchcards**: #1 was super simple; #2 was hard to visualize - a straightforward rules-based simulation 🤖
  did the trick!
* `Day 05` **If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer**:
  1. Computing is easy, but...
  2. Idea of superpositioning the individual transformation steps was easy, but implementation required mental clarity I am usual short of! 🤯
* `Day 06` **Wait For It**: Just solving a square equation w discrete values. I wasted an insane amount of time
  because of using 'analogue' approach instead of 'digital' one (starting at line 19)... w/o taking some time to think
  it over. 🫠
* `Day 07` **Camel Cards**: Puzzle #2 really required a keen eye 🤤 when reading the description.

Up there, prefix _'M'_ stands for _main_ and _'D'_ for _demo data_.<br>
When some results from step #1 are re-used, then step #2 can be quicker.
